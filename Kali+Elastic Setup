<h1>Initial Steps </h1>

You will need Kali virtualised (I used VirtualBox) and an account on https://www.elastic.co

Once Kali in running, navigate over to Elastic and click the drop down menu on top-left to "Add Integrations"

Select "Elastic Defend" and install it, it will then prompt you to install Elastic Agent on your host which is your Kali instance in this case

Copy the CLI command and paste it into Kali
